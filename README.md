## Description

This react portfolio is all about showcasing my skills and work samples in an organized and easy-to-navigate format. 

The `header` features my name and navigation titles, while the content section includes sections for About Me, Skills, Portfolio, and Contact. 

The `footer` provides quick access to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and a third platform profile. 

In the `About Me` section, you'll find a photo of me and a short bio. 

The `Portfolio` section displays six of my applications with links to both the deployed versions and my corresponding GitHub repository. 

The `Contact` section includes a form for you to get in touch with me, complete with required fields and email address validation. 

Finally, in my About Me section, there's a link to a downloadable version of my `resume` or `CV` and a list of my proficiencies.
